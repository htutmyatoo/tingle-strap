## 📌 Overview

[Tingle Strap](https://htutmyatoo.github.io/tingle-strap/) is a wearable chest-mounted proximity awareness system designed to enhance spatial awareness in dynamic environments.

The concept originated during the COVID-19 pandemic, where maintaining safe physical distance became a global challenge. While inspired by that context, the system is not limited to health-related scenarios. It serves as a foundational wearable IoT prototype for real-time spatial monitoring applications.

The device performs **multi-directional (360°) distance detection** using ultrasonic sensors, integrates motion sensing through PIR detection, and provides immediate visual and audio feedback when predefined proximity thresholds are breached.

This project demonstrates applied embedded systems design, sensor integration, and wearable IoT prototyping.

## 🎯 Key Features

- 360° ultrasonic proximity detection  
- PIR motion awareness integration  
- Real-time alert feedback (LED + Buzzer)  
- Configurable safety threshold (default: 182.88 cm / 6 ft)  
- Wearable chest-mounted prototype  
- Modular firmware structure  
- Designed for scalability and future optimization  

## 🧠 System Architecture

Tingle Strap follows a simplified IoT layered structure:

</p>

## 📏 Detection Logic

- Default safety threshold: **182.88 cm (6 feet)**
- Each ultrasonic sensor monitors a fixed direction
- If **any direction** detects an object within threshold:
  - 🔴 Red LED activates  
  - 🔊 Buzzer sounds  
- If all directions remain outside threshold:
  - 🟢 Green LED remains active  

The PIR sensor enhances environmental responsiveness and supports motion-based context awareness.

## ⚙️ Hardware Components

- Arduino Uno  
- 4 × HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensors  
- PIR Motion Sensor  
- Piezo Buzzer  
- Red LED
- Blue LED 
- Green LED  
- Resistors  
- Breadboard / Custom Mount  
- 5V Power Bank  
- Wearable Chest Strap Assembly
